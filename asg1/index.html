    <h2>Three Things I Learned</h2>
    <p>1. The web has evolved from basic static web pages into advanced interactive platforms according to my learning experience.</p>
    <p>2. Web trends tend to follow cycles because original concepts can reappear through modern interpretations..</p>
    <p>3. The selection of design elements determines how users experience websites and how much trust they place in them</p>

    <h2>My Semester Project Idea</h2>
    <p>I would like to build a simple interactive website that shows information in a creative way.</p>
