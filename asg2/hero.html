    <h3>Overview</h3> 
   
    <p>Hela is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is based on the Norse goddess Hel and first appeared in <em>Journey into Mystery</em> #102, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Hela rules over Hel and Niflheim, where she governs the spirits of the dead who are not honored in Valhalla.</p>

    <p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hela made her live-action debut in <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (2017), portrayed by Cate Blanchett. She is depicted as the older sister of Thor and Loki, returning to reclaim Asgard after Odin’s death. Blanchett’s performance was praised for her commanding and sinister presence, cementing Hela as one of the most powerful villains in the MCU.</p>

    <p>Hela’s powers are vast — she possesses superhuman strength, durability, and the ability to regenerate. She can conjure an endless supply of bladed weapons, summon undead warriors, and bend others to her will. Her necromantic control of the dead makes her a nearly unstoppable force in battle.</p>

    <p>Her ultimate goal is to extend her dominion far beyond Hel, beginning with Asgard itself. She seeks to use its armies and resources to conquer other realms, establishing herself as the supreme ruler. This ambition places her in direct conflict with Thor and the remaining Asgardians, who resist her ruthless vision of empire and death.</p>
