  <h1>Understanding Structured Content and Semantic HTML</h1>

  <h2>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h2>
  <p>Structured content refers to the process of organizing information into a structured format which separates content from visual presentation defines structured content. The structured format of text and images and other elements creates a meaningful arrangement.

  <h2>How do they work together?</h2>
  <p>The combination of structured content and semantic HTML works well together. The logical organization of information through structured content receives its proper coding representation through semantic HTML markup. The combination of these elements enables better comprehension of content by human users and machine-based systems such as screen readers and search engines..</p>

  <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
  <p>Having both structured content and semantic HTML is important because it improves accessibility to users and search engines while being easier to maintain. The approach makes content meaningful and simple to navigate while providing flexibility for different devices and technologies.</p>

  <h1>Reflection</h1>

  <h2>Banishing Your Inner Critic</h2>
  <p>Denise Jacobs describes the “inner critic” as a troll-like voice that can hold us back. Of the methods she suggests, the one that would be most successful for me is focusing on self-compassion. By reminding myself that creativity improves with practice and mistakes are part of learning, I can silence the negative voice and move forward with confidence.</p>

  <h2>Procrastination (David McRaney)</h2>
  <p>David McRaney explains “hyperbolic discounting” as the tendency to choose smaller, immediate rewards over larger, future ones. One method to counteract this is breaking tasks into smaller steps, so the reward feels more immediate. For me, this would work best because achieving small goals quickly helps me stay motivated and resist procrastination.</p>

  <h2>Critical Web Design: Chapter 1</h2>
  <p>The reading identifies four types of power in networks: networking power, networked power, network-making power, and networked governance. As a creator and publisher of my work, I currently have network-making power in a limited way — I can design, organize, and present content online, but my reach is still small. With more experience and publishing practice, I can strengthen this power and connect with broader networks.</p>
