    <h2>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h2>
    <p>
      A violation of guideline #6 (clickable elements are not obvious) can be found on 
      <a href="http://www.arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a>.  
      The site is overloaded with images and text, and links are buried in clutter, 
      making it unclear what is actually clickable. This violates usability principles.

    <h2>Better User Experience Through Storytelling</h2>
    <p>
      Framing a project in a story format helps refine ideas by providing a clear narrative 
      structure for the user’s journey. Stories naturally include a beginning (the user’s 
      problem), middle (the process of finding solutions), and end (how the website resolves 
      the problem). This storytelling approach ensures the design aligns with user needs 
      while also making the experience more memorable and emotionally engaging. For example, 
      <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> uses storytelling 
      effectively by presenting traveler stories that highlight how the platform 
      solves real-world needs.

    <h2>Meet Your Type: Typography Hierarchy</h2>
    <p>
      Typography hierarchy can be created by varying font sizes, weights (bold vs. light), 
      colors, spacing, capitalization, or style (serif vs. sans-serif). These distinctions 
      guide the user’s attention toward the most important information first. 
      A good example of hierarchy is on 
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> homepage, 
      where headlines, subheadings, and body text are carefully styled to create a 
      natural reading flow.

    <h2>Creative Brief</h2>

    <h3>Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Many websites in the creative portfolio space lack clarity or overwhelm users 
      with too many visuals. The problem is finding a balance between showcasing work 
      and ensuring usability.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Young professionals, recruiters, and potential clients who want to quickly 
      understand the designer’s work, skills, and personality through a clear 
      and engaging interface.
    </p>

    <h3>Competition</h3>
    <p>
      Sites like <a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.behance.net/" target="_blank">Behance</a> serve as competition, 
      offering highly visual showcases but often lacking personalization or narrative flow.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Messages</h3>
    <p>
      The website should communicate creativity, professionalism, and usability. 
      It should make clear that good design is both functional and visually appealing.
    </p>

    <h3>Call to Action</h3>
    <p>
      Encourage visitors to browse the portfolio, learn about the designer’s 
      process, and reach out for collaboration or job opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>How to Measure Success</h3>
    <p>
      Success will be measured by metrics such as portfolio views, time spent on pages, 
      inquiries from potential clients/employers, and user feedback on design clarity.
