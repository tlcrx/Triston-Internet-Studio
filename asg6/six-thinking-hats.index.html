      <h2>The White Hat – Information & Facts</h2>
      <p>
        My partner and I began by focusing on factual details about my semester project.
        We reviewed the project’s goals, available data, and user research to identify
        the gaps in information that could be filled. This helped us clarify what data
        supports my current design direction and what additional research would
        improve accuracy and user understanding.

      <h2>The Red Hat – Emotions & Intuition</h2>
      <p>
        When we put on the Red Hat, emotions and instincts came into play. We discussed
        how users might feel when interacting with the interface — whether it evokes
        trust, curiosity, or frustration. My partner noted that visual warmth and
        tone can heavily influence perception, reminding me that emotional design
        is as powerful as functionality.

      <h2>The Black Hat – Critical Thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Under the Black Hat, we explored potential flaws and weaknesses in my design.
        My partner challenged the efficiency of certain navigation choices and
        accessibility standards. I personally relate to the Black Hat the most,
        since I naturally focus on identifying risks and areas for improvement
        to ensure a stronger, more reliable user experience.

      <h2>The Yellow Hat – Optimism & Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Wearing the Yellow Hat, we identified the project’s most positive aspects.
        My partner appreciated the clarity of the design layout and the engaging
        color scheme. We concluded that the project’s potential to enhance
        user satisfaction and simplify navigation stood out as its strongest value.

    <section class="hat green-hat">
      <h2>The Green Hat – Creativity & New Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        The Green Hat conversation centered on innovation. We brainstormed creative
        enhancements such as micro-interactions, user onboarding animations, and
        expanded accessibility features. These ideas opened new possibilities for
        engagement and gave the project a refreshed sense of energy and growth.

    <section class="hat blue-hat">
      <h2>The Blue Hat – Organization & Control</h2>
      <p>
        With the Blue Hat, we focused on management and structure. We established a
        clearer workflow for project milestones, refining how tasks are tracked
        and evaluated. This discussion helped define priorities and ensured that
        the project remains consistent and cohesive through completion.

    <section class="hat reflection">
      <h2>Reflection – Project Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        After the Six Thinking Hats discussion, my project evolved significantly.
        By combining analytical, emotional, and creative perspectives, I refined
        both the interface and research strategy. The dialogue emphasized the
        importance of balancing optimism with realism, and organization with
        experimentation. This process strengthened my confidence in iterative
        design and encouraged me to pursue a more holistic approach to problem-solving.
