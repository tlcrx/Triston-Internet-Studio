  <h1>Six Thinking Hats Project Reflection</h1>

  <section class="white-hat">
    <h2>White Hat – Facts and Information</h2>
    <p>My partner and I discussed the objective data about the project, such as our research sources, usability testing feedback, and interface performance metrics. We identified gaps in our data collection process and agreed that additional survey responses would improve our analysis accuracy. This factual review grounded our future design adjustments in measurable evidence rather than assumptions.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="red-hat">
    <h2>Red Hat – Feelings and Intuition</h2>
    <p>We reflected on our emotional reactions to the project’s progress. My partner felt that the project’s design phase was rewarding but also stressful due to frequent revisions. I shared similar emotions, acknowledging that some decisions were based more on instinct than logic. This conversation helped us recognize the emotional investment we had in maintaining user-centered design principles.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="black-hat">
    <h2>Black Hat – Caution and Judgment</h2>
    <p>We critically evaluated potential weaknesses. My partner pointed out that the color palette might not meet accessibility standards for users with visual impairments. We also questioned whether the navigation flow was intuitive enough for first-time users. This hat helped us identify realistic challenges that could reduce usability if not addressed early. This is the hat I personally relate to the most, as it reflects my dominant thinking style of caution, logic, and critique.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="yellow-hat">
    <h2>Yellow Hat – Optimism and Benefits</h2>
    <p>Under this perspective, we emphasized what was working well. We appreciated the project’s clean layout, positive feedback from peers, and consistent typography. This optimistic focus motivated us to preserve these strengths while continuing to refine weaker areas.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="green-hat">
    <h2>Green Hat – Creativity and New Ideas</h2>
    <p>We brainstormed new ways to enhance the project, such as integrating microinteractions to improve engagement and introducing a dark mode option for accessibility. The discussion inspired several creative additions that aligned with user preferences and modern UI trends.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="blue-hat">
    <h2>Blue Hat – Process and Organization</h2>
    <p>We discussed how to structure our workflow moving forward. My partner suggested setting weekly milestones to track progress and reduce last-minute stress. We also decided to document design changes to maintain clarity across updates. This structured approach will help ensure smoother collaboration and consistent design execution.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-change">
    <h2>Project Changes After Discussion</h2>
    <p>After applying the Six Thinking Hats framework, our project evolved to prioritize clarity, creativity, and inclusivity. We adjusted our design for better accessibility, expanded our data collection methods, and added interactive elements that enhance user experience. This structured reflection ultimately improved both our process and our final product quality.</p>
