  <h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Six Thinking Hats method, developed by Edward de Bono, is a structured way of looking at
    problems from multiple perspectives. Each hat represents a unique thinking styleâ€”facts,
    emotions, caution, optimism, creativity, and management. By separating these modes, groups can
    think more clearly and make better decisions.

  <h2>The Hats</h2>

  <h3>White Hat: Information</h3>
  <p>
    Focuses on facts, data, and information available. Questions include: What do we know? What do we
    need to know?
  </p>

  <h3>Red Hat: Emotion</h3>
  <p>
    Expresses feelings, hunches, and intuition. Allows emotions to be part of decision-making without
    needing justification.
  </p>

  <h3>Black Hat: Judgment</h3>
  <p>
    Cautions against risks, weaknesses, and potential problems. Encourages critical thinking and
    logical caution.
  </p>

  <h3>Yellow Hat: Optimism</h3>
  <p>
    Highlights benefits, value, and opportunities. Looks for why something could succeed and its
    positive impact.
  </p>

  <h3>Green Hat: Creativity</h3>
  <p>
    Generates new ideas, alternatives, and possibilities. Encourages different approaches to problem
    solving.
  </p>

  <h3>Blue Hat: Management</h3>
  <p>
    Focuses on process control, organization, and decision-making. Keeps discussion structured and
    guides next steps.
