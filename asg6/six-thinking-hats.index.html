  <h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The Six Thinking Hats method, developed by Edward de Bono, is a structured way of looking at
    problems from multiple perspectives. Each hat represents a unique thinking styleâ€”facts,
    emotions, caution, optimism, creativity, and management. By separating these modes, groups can
    think more clearly and make better decisions. 
  </p>

  <h2>The Hats</h2>

  <h3 class="white-hat">White Hat: Information</h3>
  <p>
    Focuses on facts, data, and information available. Questions include: What do we know? What do we
    need to know?
  </p>

  <h3 class="red-hat">Red Hat: Emotion</h3>
  <p>
    Expresses feelings, hunches, and intuition. Allows emotions to be part of decision-making without
    needing justification.
  </p>

  <h3 class="black-hat">Black Hat: Judgment</h3>
  <p>
    The black hat cautions against risks, weaknesses, and potential problems. It encourages critical thinking and logical caution.
