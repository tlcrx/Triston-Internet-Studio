    <!-- SECTION 1: Candidate Bio -->
    <section class="bio">
      <h2>Meet Lord Starkiller</h2>
      <img src="images/starkiller.jpg" alt="Lord Starkiller" class="candidate-img" />

      <p>
        Lord Starkiller, born Galen Marek, was once the secret apprentice of Darth Vader.
        Known for his unmatched control over the Force and mastery of both lightsaber combat and strategy,
        Starkiller stands as a symbol of balance between passion and control. His strength, precision, and
        loyalty have made him a force feared across the galaxy — and respected by all who value power with purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a ruler, Starkiller would lead with discipline, decisiveness, and vision.
        His experience on both the light and dark sides of the Force grants him unique wisdom:
        true strength comes from understanding both sides of power. Under his leadership,
        the galaxy would see an end to chaos, corruption, and endless civil war.

    <aside class="sidebar">
      <h2>Running Mate: Ahsoka Tano</h2>
      <img src="images/ahsoka.jpg" alt="Ahsoka Tano" class="runningmate-img" />

      <p>
        Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, embodies justice, empathy,
        and moral strength. Her independent leadership style complements Starkiller’s raw power.
        Together, they bridge both the light and dark sides — a partnership built on balance and unity.
        Ahsoka’s diplomacy and compassion ensure that Starkiller’s empire would not just command obedience,
        but inspire hope and fairness across star systems.

    <!-- SECTION 3: Campaign Platform -->
    <section class="platform">
      <h2>Our Campaign Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Lord Starkiller’s platform focuses on restoring galactic order through three pillars:
        <strong>Unity, Strength, and Evolution.</strong>  
        He envisions a galaxy free from division, governed by a council of balance — where
        both the Force-sensitive and non-sensitive coexist without fear.  
        Technological innovation, planetary restoration, and transparent governance will guide
        this new era. Under Starkiller’s leadership, peace will no longer be a fragile dream,
        but a lasting reality forged through strength and understanding.
