      <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Sketching wireframes by hand allows designers to quickly explore multiple ideas without being constrained by software tools.
        It encourages creativity and helps communicate early design concepts in an informal, collaborative way. However, hand sketches
        can be less precise, difficult to share digitally, and not easily updated as project details evolve. Wireframing software, on the other hand,
        provides accuracy, easy iteration, and team collaboration capabilities but can sometimes slow down the creative process during the early ideation stages.

      <h2>Which Wireframing Style Works Best for My Project</h2>
      <p>
        For my project, a digital wireframing tool would work best because it allows me to create clean, interactive, and scalable layouts for web pages.
        Since my design focuses on structure, alignment, and color coordination, software like Figma or Adobe XD ensures consistency across multiple screens.
        It also simplifies revisions and makes it easier to present professional wireframes to clients or instructors for feedback.
