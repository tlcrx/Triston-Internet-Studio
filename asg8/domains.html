      <h3>Discussion Summary</h3>
      <p>
        After presenting my potential domain names to a classmate, we analyzed each option
        based on memorability, thematic relevance, and linguistic appeal. Our discussion
        emphasized the importance of aligning the domain with the intended user experience and
        project focus. My classmate suggested that the name should not only capture the
        technological sophistication of the infotainment system but also maintain a sense of
        simplicity and brand recognition. This collaboration provided meaningful insight into
        how subtle variations in language and tone can influence the perception of a digital brand.

      <h3>Chosen Domain and Justification</h3>
      <p>
        The domain name I selected is <strong>enviedrive.com</strong>. This choice best represents the
        project’s blend of technological advancement and refined design aesthetics. The use of
        “envie,” meaning “desire” in French, adds a sophisticated cultural element that resonates
        with innovation and aspiration. It also connects emotionally with users, symbolizing the
        desire for seamless, intelligent interaction while driving. From a branding perspective,
        this domain encapsulates both modernity and elegance, making it an ideal fit for the
        Envy Infotainment System.
